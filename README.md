# Sliver Searcher

Welcome to the sliver searcher, where we try different string-searching algorithms to find that sliver of performance we need!

Implemented algorithms:
- A naive one for comparison
- A slightly optimized version of the naive one
- [Knuth-Morris-Pratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm)

TODO:
- [Boyer-Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string-search_algorithm)
- [Two-way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-way_string-matching_algorithm)
