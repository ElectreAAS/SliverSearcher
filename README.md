# Sliver Searcher

Welcome to the sliver searcher, where we try different string-searching algorithms to find that sliver of performance we need!

## Wikipedia warning ⚠️
I linked below to the wiki pages of the algos I implemented, but those pages can be **very wrong**.
Read at your own risk.

Implemented algorithms:
- A naive one for comparison
- A slightly optimized version of the naive one
- [Knuth-Morris-Pratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm)
- [Boyer-Moore-Horspool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore%E2%80%93Horspool_algorithm)
